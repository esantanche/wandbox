Wandbox, Raspberry Pi 3 Laptop 
===================

This is a project for a laptop based on Raspberry Pi 3.
The components are contained in a plywood box.
The monitor will be mounted on top of the box.

Where to begin
--------------
Schematics_Components.odg shows how the laptop's components are placed and how power flows from the external power 
supply to the battery charger, to the batteries, to the switch and, from there to all other components.

The documents whose name begins with "Components" describe single components, where I plan to buy them from and
give technical details.

The documents whose name begins with "Tools" describe tools I'll use for the project.

The documents whose name begins with "Detail" show solutions used to solve specific problems.
